STEPS IN CREATING THIS REPO

I went to my github account I created a new repository named PLPBasicGitAssignment and initialized it with a README file

Then I went to my local files I created a directory under documents named PLPBasicGitAssignment

Using Git bash as my command line I navigated to my directory I created "PLPBasicGitAssignment" using cd documents/PLPBasicGitAssignment/ and I initialized using git init

I linked my local repository with my remote repository using git remote add origin <repository-url>

I created a text file "hello.txt" in that directory using touch hello.txt

I openned that text file and added a text "hello, git"

In my git bash I staged the changes using git add hello.txt then commited the changes using git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greetings"

Then I pushed my changes to the remote repo in github using  git push -u origin master

To the github I refreshed the page and I was able to see hello.txt file I created
